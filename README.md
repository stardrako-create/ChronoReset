# ChronoReset

**A literature-grounded control-policy experiment for aging intervention scheduling.**

ChronoReset asks a narrow, testable question: given a patient tracked across several Hallmarks of Aging with *real* cross-hallmark coupling constraints (not made up), does the order you intervene in actually matter — and does the obvious strategy (treat whatever's worst) hold up against alternatives?

This is deliberately **not** a mechanistic aging model. It doesn't try to be biologically accurate. It's a decision-policy sandbox where the *coupling rules between hallmarks* are grounded in real papers, and the thing under test is scheduling strategy, not biology.

## The setup

Six hallmarks (López-Otín et al. 2023, *Cell*, "Hallmarks of aging: An expanding universe"), each a dysfunction level in `[0, 1]`:

- **Deregulated nutrient-sensing** (`mtor` / `autophagy_foxo`) — the mTOR/AMPK/FOXO axis
- **Disabled macroautophagy**
- **Chronic inflammation** ("inflammaging")
- **Telomere attrition**
- **Cellular senescence**
- **Mitochondrial dysfunction**

Each has an intervention function (rapamycin-style mTOR inhibition, fasting/spermidine-style autophagy induction, anti-inflammatory, telomerase activation, senolytic clearance, NAD+/mitophagy induction). Interventions don't just move their own node — they nudge coupled nodes, with **coefficients tiered by strength of evidence**, not fitted to data:

| Coefficient | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `STEP_SIZE/2` | Direct mechanistic coupling or strong human interventional data |
| `STEP_SIZE/4` | Established causal link, animal/mechanistic evidence |
| `STEP_SIZE/8` | Real but context-specific / partial effect |

## What the coupling rules are actually based on

- **mTOR ↔ autophagy (hard, `/2`)**: not a soft correlation — mTORC1 and AMPK phosphorylate the *same residue set* on ULK1 in opposite directions (Kim, Kundu, Viollet & Guan 2011, *Nat Cell Biol*). The strongest-evidenced coupling in the model.
- **Autophagy → inflammation/mitochondria (`/4`)**: mitophagy clears damaged mitochondria/mtDNA that would otherwise trigger NLRP3 (Gupta et al. 2025); mitophagy is mechanistically a subset of macroautophagy (Ryu et al. 2016, *Nat Med*).
- **Telomerase → senescence (`/2`) and → CAR-T fitness**: critically short telomeres drive replicative senescence via ATM/ATR-p53; telomerase suppresses it. Transient TERT mRNA gave CD19 CAR-T cells ~300x vs 37x expansion and ~80% survival vs near-total death in controls in xenograft models (Bai et al. 2015, *Cell Discovery*).
- **Telomerase → inflammation (small, `/8`, a *cost* not a benefit)**: TERT has documented non-canonical pro-inflammatory signaling via STING, independent of telomere length (Akincilar et al. 2025, *Nat Cell Biol*) — but whole-organism AAV9-TERT gene therapy showed no organism-level inflammatory pathology (Bernardes de Jesus et al. 2012, *EMBO Mol Med*), so this is a small penalty, not a block.
- **Inflammation → telomere attrition (small, `/8`)**: cytokine-driven ROS accelerates telomeric DNA damage; this is *not* a strict either/or with telomerase activation as originally hypothesized — two independent literature passes found the two hallmarks are described as mutually *reinforcing* on the damage side, not exclusive.
- **Senescence → inflammation (`/2`)**: best human evidence of any two-hallmark link here — 3 days of dasatinib+quercetin cut circulating IL-1α, IL-6, MMP-9/12 within 11 days (Hickson et al. 2019).
- **Mitochondrial dysfunction → senescence/inflammation (`/4`)**: MiDAS (mitochondrial dysfunction-associated senescence) and mitophagy curtailing cytosolic-mtDNA-driven cGAS-STING activation (Fang et al. 2024, *Nat Commun*).
- **Senolytic "hit-and-run" dosing**: modeled as reduced efficacy on immediate repeat, not a block — matches the intermittent dosing paradigm validated in mouse senolytic trials (Xu et al. 2018; Justice et al. 2019).
- **NAD+ floor effect**: mitochondrial intervention has reduced efficacy above a threshold, matching the finding that NAD+ repletion doesn't improve already-healthy mitochondria, only depleted ones (Mills et al. 2016, *Cell Metab*).

## The actual result: does ordering matter?

Five policies, same starting patient, same coupling rules:

```
policy                                  doses    burden  cancer_risk  car_t_fit
synergy-aware (1-step lookahead)           12    20.075        0.075      0.675
round-robin                                12    21.325        0.025      0.550
greedy (worst-first)                       11    22.188        0.025      0.550
random (seed=0)                            14    25.931        0.075      0.675
fixed priority (mtor/autophagy first)      17    26.513        0.075      0.675
```

**Ordering matters, but it's a tradeoff, not a clean win.** Synergy-aware lookahead (treat whatever helps the whole system most, not just the worst node) minimizes total patient burden — but gets there by re-dosing telomerase more, which is exactly the side effect the model penalizes (`cancer_risk` 0.075 vs 0.025). Greedy worst-first — never actually validated before this — turns out to be a reasonable point on the burden-vs-safety frontier: fewest doses, near-best burden, avoids the extra safety cost. Round-robin, with *zero* information about severity, nearly matches greedy — meaning in this coupling structure, which hallmark you treat matters less than whether the coupling exists at all. Fixed-priority (always clear mTOR/autophagy first regardless of severity) is clearly worst.

## Running it

No dependencies beyond the standard library.

```bash
python hallmarks_model.py
```

Runs the greedy-policy trace once, then `compare_policies()` runs all five policies from the same initial state and prints the comparison table above.

## Limitations

- **This is a scheduling-policy sandbox, not a biological simulator.** Coupling coefficients are evidence-tier heuristics (`/2`, `/4`, `/8`), not fitted parameters. Treat the *relative* policy comparison as the finding, not the absolute numbers.
- **No hormesis / non-monotonic dose-response.** Exercise-like interventions (not yet modeled) would need a "more isn't always better" curve — e.g. AMPK-mediated p53 activation is adaptive/mitochondrial-biogenesis-promoting at moderate acute stress but drives senescence at chronic/excessive stress. The current model treats every intervention as monotonically beneficial to its target, which doesn't hold for stress-hormetic interventions.
- **FOXM1's relationship to this model is unverified.** There's a plausible mTOR→FOXM1→senescence-suppression chain (mTORC1 activity reportedly promotes FOXM1 expression in some cancer-cell contexts, and FOXM1 loss is associated with senescence entry) but this hasn't been through the same literature-verification pass as the rest of the model and is **not** encoded here.
- **Discrete-time, rule-based, not a coupled ODE/SciML system.** The node names and coupling *directions* are the part meant to be right first; a continuous dynamical system could replace the update loop later without changing the node definitions.
- **Single patient, deterministic given a policy.** No population variation, no stochastic disease progression.
